● The best way to learn is by doing. That’s why our cohort-based courses focus on active
learning through hands-on assignments and projects.
● Everyone should have access to the best instructors. Removing the limitations of geography
means that anyone in the world can access industry experts.

HOW IS SIGLENS DIFFERENT?
SigLens has build a observability database from scratch that is 100x more efficient and several magnitudes faster than current solutions in the industry. With SigLens, companies can use one single system for all data types, reduce costs by 90% and also have lightening fast query response times. SigLens helps reduce your downtime.
Below are 3 key innovations with SigLens Database:
1) Dynamic columnar compressions:
SigLens chooses a compression compression on a column based on the past 5 minutes of data and keeps adaptively changing it as the shape of the data changes. This helps achieve more than 95% storage savings with zero configurations.
2) Dynamic micro-indexing
Micro-index are like the database indexes, except they are 1/100th the size of an actual index. Using these micro-indexes SigLens can search/filter without uncompressing 98% of the data.
3) Agile Aggregation Trees.
These trees help answer aggregation queries at lightening speeds. These trees are built dynamically during ingestion."
